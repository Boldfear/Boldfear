      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>
      Our campaign is about all about connecting with our brand vision. The message we want to sheir is: go outise with your Boldfear sneakers and enjoy the world around you. We want them to feel connected with our brand and connect to our vision. With our posts on social media, we want people to realize that there are many fun places to visit. That is why we came up with challenges for our target audience. 
<p>
        We set several objectives for our campaigns on Instagram and TikTok.
      </p>
        Reach opjectives:
      
     <li> April 12th, we want our brand to be seen by 200 people via Instagram.
      <li> April 12th, we want our brand to be seen by 100 people via TikTok.

      

        </p>

        Affect objectives:
        <li> April 12th, we want 20 likes on your last Instagram posted on the 8th of April.
        <li>April 12th, we want 5 likes on your last TikTok posted on the 8th of April. 
          </p>

        Response objectives:
        <li>April 12th, we want 20 clicks to our website via our Instagram account.
        <li>April 12th, we want 10 clicks to our website via our TikTok account.</p>

      <p>
      We used TikTok and Instagram to promote our brand. Out of our research with our target group we figured out that they mostly use Instagram, TikTok and snapchat. Snapchat is not really a marketing social media app in our opinion because most of the snapchat users only use the sending pictures to each other and there you will not see any adds. So we figured to use TikTok and Instagram as our social media campaign because it will give a big ranch.
      </p>

        We used Instagram for executing our campaign. Instagram is easy to use, easy to gain followers and the perfect place to be creative with your posts. Next to that, it is the perfect place for our target audience to discover new brands and get influenced. That is why we set the objectives that we mentioned above. We expected to gain more from Instagram than TikTok. 
        </p>

        We used TikTok to be creative with videos. Nowadays, TikTok is one of the most used apps online. TikTok is all based on algorhitm so if we do it right, we can reach a lot people. We created interactive videos to let our target audience feel connected. The objectives we set for TikTok were a bit lower than Instagram. This because we found out that people get more influenced on Instagram.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>

      We have learned a lot during this project. How to start a business, how to promote a new brand and how to use social media to it. In the beginnning, we brainstromed a lot about how we are going to share our message. We really liked the project because we were free to use our creativity and could invent all our ideas. 
      </p>
      We found it hard to post on social media on time. Sometimes we forgot to post or we did not have our posts ready. For text time, we should have our posts ready a few weeks in advance. This will definitely help with posting on time. 
      </p>
      On TikTok we posted twice a week. On Tuesday a video on a secret spot and on Friday the exact place. On some videos we got over 700 views which we did not expect. If our videos really help with letting people relalizes that they should go outside, we are not sure. We give them inspiration where they could go to. Out of our solution interviews, we can conclude that people like this idea.
      </p>
      On Instagram we posted twice a week. When we look back on this planning, this could be more to let people remember us. Twice a week was not enough to make people enthusastic. We have learned to use soft shell marketing for our posts. Next to that, gaining followrs was harder than we thought. We start following people without any posts which was a wrong decision. People had no idea what Boldfear was and they did not care. Next time when we start gaining followers we have to have our account on point.
      </p>
      Next time, we want to promote our product more. We focused mostly on our vision which was good for sharing our values but it is not clear that we are a sneaker brand. We should have shown that.</p>
      
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>
        If this project continues, we have to be more active on our socials. We want to post on Instagram 5 times a week instead of 2. We want to post more information about the product. Photos and videos of our sneakers visiting great places. Next to that, it is imporant to sell them pro-active. Create more marketing posts to get them to buy our sneakers.

      </p>
  
        We experienced this project as very chaotic because all the subjects overlapped. For the marketing assignment, we started too late. We missed the first opportunities to post on social media. Next time we have to start earlier and have a social media planning with actual posts so we do not have to stress out on the day it self. We divided the tasks which worked out well.
