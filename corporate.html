      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan.
      Our campaign is about all about connecting with our brand vision. The message we want to sheir is: go outise with your Boldfear sneakers and enjoy the world around you. We want them to feel connected with our brand and connect to our vision. With our posts on social media, we want people to realize that there are many fun places to visit. That is why we came up with challenges for our target audience. 

        We set several objectives for our campaigns on Instagram and TikTok.
        Reach opjectives:
        - April 12th, we want our brand to be seen by 200 people via Instagram.
        - April 12th, we want our brand to be seen by 100 people via TikTok.

        Affect objectives:
        - April 12th, we want 20 likes on your last Instagram posted on the 8th of April.
        - April 12th, we want 5 likes on your last TikTok posted on the 8th of April. 

        Response objectives:
        - April 12th, we want 20 clicks to our website via our Instagram account.
        - April 12th, we want 10 clicks to our website via our TikTok account.</p>

      <p>Explain and justify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a solid connection to the objectives established in the Communication & Media Plan.
      We used TikTok and Instagram to promote our brand. Out of our research with our target group we figured out that they mostly use Instagram, TikTok and snapchat. Snapchat is not really a marketing social media app in our opinion because most of the snapchat users only use the sending pictures to each other and there you will not see any adds. So we figured to use TikTok and Instagram as our social media campaign because it will give a big ranch.

        We used Instagram for executing our campaign. Instagram is easy to use, easy to gain followers and the perfect place to be creative with your posts. Next to that, it is the perfect place for our target audience to discover new brands and get influenced. That is why we set the objectives that we mentioned above. We expected to gain more from Instagram than TikTok. 

        We used TikTok to be creative with videos. Nowadays, TikTok is one of the most used apps online. TikTok is all based on algorhitm so if we do it right, we can reach a lot people. We created interactive videos to let our target audience feel connected. The objectives we set for TikTok were a bit lower than Instagram. This because we found out that people get more influenced on Instagram.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>Identify and justify your learning point (based on the Communication & Media Plan). What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign? What worked and what didn’t? What went as expected and what didn’t? What would you do differently? Reflect on the past work and describe what you learned.

      We have learned a lot during this project. How to start a business, how to promote a new brand and how to use social media to it. In the beginnning, we brainstromed a lot about how we are going to share our message. We created

        We executed soft shell post on both platforms. Especially on TikTok this was a success. People can interact which make them feel more connected. On several videos we got over 600 views. On Instagram, we gained 27 followers. A bit less than expected. On Instagram, people are following the people they want to follow. It was harder than expected to get their attention.</p>
      
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>Reflection on what has been done and describe in detail what you would do if the project would continue
